            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
            laws of United States, which governing law applies to agreement
            without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to
            enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered
            a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to
            be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of
            these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
            agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace
            any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.

            condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
            failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall
            not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
            of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
            jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason,
            such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent
            such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full
            force and effect.
